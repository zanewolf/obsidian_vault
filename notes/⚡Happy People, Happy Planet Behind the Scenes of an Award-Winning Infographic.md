- how to work through a project
	- First week
		- choose a topic, only had one month to develop and submit, had to make a quick decision
		- how can they add more value once they discovered that a dataset already had their original idea, a 'happy index'
			- combine the index with an ecological footprint dataset to demonstrate the environmental costs of traditional measures of happiness
	- Second week
		- ugly chart week, early exploration
		- had to understand each other's process and aesthetic better
	- Third week
		- early visual exploration
		- selecting symbology
			- happiness => smiling face => smile emoji
		- how could symbology or legend be misinterpreted? 
		- poster or interactive? 
- lessons
	- open communication
	- divide tasks more efficiently - maybe by strength?
