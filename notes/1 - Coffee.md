I recorded my coffee usage for Dec 24th - Dec 31st 2020. It's not really representative of my normal usage since it was a holiday week versus normal week, but still.

The only thing I'm currently unhappy with is the gradient within each donut. It's not a quantitative measurement, but I thought it might be "suggestive" of "how much coffee is in my system throughout the day". So ultimately it's just a purely aesthetical choice, and might be causing confusion.
