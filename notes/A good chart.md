A good chart does the job it was created to do as quickly, comfortably, and safely as possible. 
- "quickly" needs to be defined, is it 10 seconds, 1 minute? 
- "comfortably" requires as little effort as possible from the audience to get what they need
- "safely" means lowest risk possible of audience misinterpreting a chart

Examples of jobs: 
- persuade the audience to do something
- explain something to the audience
- get the audiences' attention
- answer a question the audience asked
- allow the audience to filter or look up values


Very important to figure out the job of the chart early in the [[Dataviz Design Process]]

Lastly there needs to be a way to [[Evaluating the effectiveness of a chart]]
