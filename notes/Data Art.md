Data art is when you use data to make something a piece of artwork. It is less about the labeling and more about the aesthetic. I'll work on getting better at this, so I'll start recording data for a week/two weeks at a time and creating a data art piece from that data. These have been [[Dataviz Side Projects]] for me.
