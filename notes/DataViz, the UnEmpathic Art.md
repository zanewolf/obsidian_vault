- what is empathy good for?
	- Paul bloom book about empathy. The case for rational compassion again empathy
		- it acts like a spotlight focusing attention on one thing, biased towards those that look like us
		- as soon as statistics are mentioned, people become numb and are less likely to help
		- two types
			- affective empathy: emotion connection, being able to feel what they feel
			- cognitive empathy: rational understanding, ability to take someon'e perspective
- scaling compassion
	- dataviz, statistics, removes the single person
	- when we move people, we must offer a prodcutve outlet for that motivation. What can they do now? 
	- moved but not mobilized can 
	- Questions
	- 1.  Since storytelling is an important part of our work how do you suggest to build a framework to ensure the right balance and avoid a disconnect between your data and message? What are the key things to take into account?
    

-   Ans: Both in academic research and as practitioners, there is contradiction. Identification and empathy. When stats enter the frame, they don’t just add but compete to our understanding of the story. Cognitive dissonance in using both. Understand how are cognitive processes work, and how we feel things. To inform the slow thinking. Building “the timeline” of the storytelling. What do you show first, what do you show next? Just as we use colors and shapes, we must also think on a more conceptual level. 
    

2.  Do you recommend striving for empathy in every chart or should it build to a crescendo in a story?
    

-   Ans: I never have recommendations that use the word “every'' But every case is different. Why should we use empathy? The word empathy has been really problematic in the past couple years. We overuse the word and feel good about ourselves. What people mean by empathy is actually manipulation. See empathy as a double edged sword. 
    

  

3.  What about the importance of offering a perspective for action see: Florence Nightingale
    

-   Ans: That’s what I’m trying to argue. The motivation for research based, stats based, facts based is clear. The reason we talk about empathy is when we’re not clear if we should act, should we care? Now that we care, how do we analyse the situation. Then, how do we act? In using data viz for advocacy we use the numbers to show urgency. It doesn’t connect. When you understand you have responsibility (response + ability) then we start researching and can be analytical, because we’ve passed the line of caring. Build the models for the world that we want, not just the one we have. Where is the right place to use statistics. 
    

  

4.  Where would you suggest one start learning about techniques for empathy and ways to use it responsibly?
    

-   Ans: Recommends the book, “Data Feminism” by Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein. Intersectional data feminist perspective. Put your hang-ups aside and read the fun feminist book. Book framed as something that can be used. Not just a theory, but how to do things
    

  

5.  In addition to increased empathy you can have with a more personalized story, could it be also that the huge numbers impact people in a way they feel overwhelmed on what they can do instead of feeling empowered to affect one life?
    

-   Ans: Yes, definitely!  
    The thing is that evolution-wise, humans didn’t evolve to be able to need to care about more than their close tribe, and they also didn’t evolve to expect having wide impact beyond the scale of their tribe. But today we do, we have impact and we are required to care beyond the scale of our tribe. This gap is exactly the problem.
    

  

6.  What are other examples of activation except for donating?
    

-   Ans: It really depends on the context, but some quick ones:   

-   Volunteering with Orgs
    
-   Pressuring people in power
    
-   Organizing protest
    
-   Direct action
    
-   Boycott
    
-   …
    

  

7.  How do we mitigate the risk of building empathy for malicious causes — mixing lying with data with applying attributes for empathy? Data viz for propaganda? (Like what happened with applying psychology in design & tech)?    

-   Ans: I really love this question, and I think this is exactly the right question to ask, not of me, but of ourselves, in everything we do.  
-   For me, as a practitioner, I try to embrace the rhetorical aspect of my work and explicitly present it as a part of my design - as an invitation to engage the ideas my work presents rather than just digest them fully with 0 resistance.
    

  

8.  Empathy for the many might be hard but fear of the many (e.g. foreigners) seems to work well. How could we deal with populist use of dataviz?    

-   Ans: Another brilliant question. And here’s the tricky part - since empathy functions as a spotlight - identifying with the one and shadowing the many, dataviz CAN infact be vey useful for propaganda, as the opposite of empathy (alienation? fear? hate?) can easily scale… So yes, Dataviz works “perfectly” for xenophobia…
    

  

9.  Would it be the same when we visualise loss of biodiversity, we better show one bird or animal at first?    

-   Ans: Very interesting. I don’t know, I’m assuming the challenge of identification with animals is even greater. But I can’t say this is something I know enough about. But yes, I wouldn’t be surprised if the same dynamics are at work there as well.
    

  

10.  What’s the fear/concern that you see that is making you avoid using empathy in your work?

-   I do not avoid using empathy in my work, but I do have a concern that due to the points I made, statistics and empathy create a conflicting message. And I have a concern that when empathy is effective it may sometime be manipulative. With that being said, I do want to find ways for it to work effectively and ethically. I see no other way…
