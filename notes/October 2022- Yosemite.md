## Overview
### Dates
Fly into SLC on October 7th
Drive to Yosemite on 9th
Drive back to SLC on 16th
Fly back to Boston on 18th or 19th

### Housing 
Blake booked a campground in Dimond-O campground, but I recently learned of the BP Yosemite cabin and have reached out about its availability

### Plans & Activities
The game plan is to drive over the day before our campsite becomes available and try to snag one of the first come first sites. I think this will be really hard to do with an 9-10 hour drive ahead of us - first come first serve will probably be long gone by the time we arrive. 

Then the plan is to hire a guide to take us big wall climbing for maybe two days, spend the the other days hiking and climbing as we can. Gonna need a guidebook.
