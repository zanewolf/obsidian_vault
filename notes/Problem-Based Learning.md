**## About

 Dr. Marc Weissburg is a biology professor at Georgia Tech, and he has taught Honors Ecology for the last decade or so. When I took the class, it was the fourth iteration of Problems-Based Ecology. Our discussion in Game Lab about finding the right balance of overt information and practical context - giving information just when students need it, but not before - reminded me strongly of this class. I reached out to Marc to talk about the course design and learn about it from the professor’s side of things. 

  

## Class Set-Up

(From Syllabus)

### Overview: 

This is a problem-based learning class designed to provide you with a working, applied knowledge of the fundamental concepts and practices of ecology. The course is built around a series of five problems that introduce you to techniques such as formulating questions and hypotheses, effective literature searching, experimental design, problem-solving, and effective communication. The activities in this class are designed to support your understanding of processes that structure communities and ecosystems in mechanistic, predictive ways. You will also develop an understanding of patterns of species interactions, human alteration of the biosphere, and the importance of environmental variation in both space and time.

### Format: 

Six hours each week are scheduled for the class. Although lecture and lab are nominally separate, in practice, there will be little difference in activities between these two periods. Very little of the class will be taught in traditional lecture, nor will there be canned labs. Instead, the course consists of five three week modules designed around formulating and solving problems that require ecological knowledge, skills, and approaches. You will work in small cooperative groups of four or five, using both lecture and lab periods to work on your problems. You will design and execute experimental or empirical tests of these problems. Group membership will shuffle during the course of the semester.

  

The following rules apply to all group work:

1.  Everyone is responsible for making sure that all group members understand the problem and contribute to its solution.
    
2.  Everyone must assist one another in understanding the material and in developing skills such as focusing questions, formulating testable hypotheses, performing effective literature searches, and writing.
    
3.  Each group will prepare a joint (single) report. Each member of the group endorses the report by this submission, thereby indicating agreement with the group's conclusions, contribution to the report, and understanding of its contents. Since you will identify all the sources for your information, you must cite your sources. Violation of this policy is a violation of the GT Honor Code.
    

  

The instructors are here to facilitate your self- and group-directed learning as you search for, articulate, and present your solutions. Modules will typically begin with an instructor-led introduction to the problem. You will work with other group participants to define the problem, determine what you need to know to solve the problem, act on the problem, and present your findings. Lectures are not preplanned. Instead, the instructors will develop mini-lectures in response to student-identified needs for your learning process.

  

(From memory)

At the end of each module, the TA that had been paired with the group would meet with us individually to discuss our performance in the module, strengths, weaknesses, etc. Additionally, we had to submit a learning journal each week and discuss not necessarily the content of the class, but reflect on why we did things the way we did. 

  
  

## Notes from the conversation

-   Gave Marc the context of why I had been thinking about his course, and that I wanted to pick his brain about the design of it. 
    

-   Avoiding cognitive overload isn’t really a new thing. There are lots of commentary about problem-based approaches and the need to not be so overt about content delivery, and the idea of forcing people to define the problem for themselves and understand what is required to solve it is where this all comes from. 
    
-   A typical course gives you a lot of facts and you don’t really know what to do with them, or even try to do something with them, often until the very end, and this framework makes understanding why the facts are important difficult. If it’s not salient and you don’t think about them, then you don’t remember them. 
    
-   In this course design, we try to scaffold it as minimally as possible beyond trying to make the problem set a strong enough context so that people could figure out what they needed to know, at least on high level
    
-   When you worked in groups, we weren’t telling you what you needed to know so much as directing your attention to the things that you’ve said that would tell you what you needed to know.
    
-   This also causes some psychological chaos, especially in the beginning - there are lots of things going on in these discussions and people are saying all kinds of different things- because at this level of undergraduates (it was billed as a sophomore level course, but open to registration from any level \[e.g. I took it as a freshman\]), you were unwilling to make those decisions by yourself because everything you’ve learned about education is that those aren’t your decisions to make, they are the teacher’s decisions. 
    
-   So most of the time, our role was just to give you confidence that you were thinking in a productive way and should continue along that train of thought. 
    
-   The magic phrase was, “Do you know it or do you think it?” And how do you tell the difference? 
    
-   Probably say that like 20 or 30 times and students start thinking about what it means to know something versus think it. Eventually students get to the point where they say, “I need to learn this because I don’t really know this. I just think I know this, so I better go find the sources.” Figuring out that you need to know this is really the most important step. 
    
-   And the next decision point is, once you have figured it out, how much do we help? 
    
-   Some of the content is particularly complicated and involves a lot of jargon, or context-specific meaning - and those were the places that we would intervene
    
-   The predator versus prey dynamics, and things like that, they have a particular mathematical machinery and it didn’t seem important to me to have you wade through all that. Recognizing that you needed a hammer is important, because without the knowledge of why you need the hammer in the first place, the context of what the hammer does and why it’s shaped the way it is won’t make sense. So that’s what we did. We focused on making you realize what tool you needed first. 
    

-   Q: How did you decide what concepts to focus on and what to leave by the wayside when designing the class? 
    

-   Thought about the concepts that I wanted to give my students based on my own knowledge of the field and what I thought were the most universal and productive things to think about. And then you ask your colleagues what they think is important. This is always the question, what do you want your audience to get out of this? What they want/expect to know, what you want them to know - and you can’t define the first until you’ve thought about the second. Defining a course for majors who are want to get graduate degrees in ecology would be different than teaching a bunch of individuals that might or might not be interested in ecology - but have an interest in biology in general. 
    
-   There are some overarching themes that one can identify as necessary for just being a good thinker. Problem definition (which is probably more subtle and underemphasized). Literature searches, working in groups, communication, prioritizing information, other basic life skills and everything else on the rubric \[in folder\] (which are probably more straightforward things, and come from the higher levels of bloom’s taxonomy). And this would be applicable whether they went into ecology, or became doctors, or engineers. This set the framework for you and what the structural requirements would be for a lot of things you did outside of the content.
    
-   Regarding content, we had to make some hard decisions because we could only give you five problems. We wanted to make sure you went all the way from populations to systems, because that hierarchy underpins most of species interactions. Of all the examples we could have looked at, a lot of them would have used the same sort of ways of thinking and tools, so then the criteria would be, what can we do in three weeks. 
    
-   To make things more salient for students, we chose topics that would get you out into the field and have you connecting the information to your lives right in the state, so two of the modules involved actually taking you out into the field to collect water samples - connect it to the larger context of sustainability and societal themes - or see examples of succession on Mount Arabia. Problem-based learning observation. There are things in the community that are salient. So we tried to figure out a combination of things that would satisfy all of those criteria. There’s no one right way to do it. You could probably pick another five things that would still work. 
    

-   Q: Did the problems change much throughout your teaching the class? What worked and what didn’t? 
    

-   Three of the original five worked pretty well, but two got swapped out, because the implementations didn’t work for one reason or another (hard to implement, data was murky, it wasn’t outside). So the first year had a couple of really spectacular failures. 
    
-   And getting the context right is critical. They need to understand what they need to understand. Our ability to tell a story made a big impact on the problems we selected. If you can’t tell a good story about the problem, it’s going to be hard for people to understand what the problem is. 
    

-   Q: How did the roles of the TAs change over time? Were they more active at the beginning and then you reduced their role as the class structure became more solidified? 
    

-   Other people who had done courses like this told us you need a lot of observation, you need to be able to work with every group every day. You don’t need to be with them all the time, but we set a rule early on that we would sit every day with each group for at least half and hour, or 45 minutes. So that meant the TAs needed to do exactly the same thing I did - there was no difference in our roles (except I kept some decision-making authority). Some TAs were even a lot better at this, because our roles were mostly about listening to people talk about stuff, and to do so carefully. The only thing TAs really needed from me was specific guidance on why a certain idea might get stuck, or why somebody would get stuck on a certain idea, and how to get students over some sort of a conceptual gap in their understanding. And that knowledge just comes from 20-30 years of having students tell me that they don’t understand something, and figuring out what their problems are and how to solve them. 
    
-   TAs needed to be good observers, to be able to apply the rubrics and have interactions with students where they can say, I notice you did this at that time and it might’ve been better if you had done X. Or, one of your habits is to do this, and you should think about why you do that because it’s probably holding you back. 
    
-   The student evaluations and the feedback they get from us is a critical part - giving students the metacognitive perspective of understanding how they think, and how it can and should change/improve. Without that, you’re not learning how to learn, and they won’t improve throughout the course nearly as quickly. 
    

-   Q: Have you noticed any disadvantages or cons from this way of structuring the class? 
    

-   It doesn’t work for some segment of the population, which is common, but it might be a bit more serious for this particular way of learning because the other way of learning \[memorization\] is so embedded in people’s experience.
    
-   People might think that learning in this problem-based way isn’t learning, and it stems from a fundamental confusion of what it means to understand something. People might believe that understanding things means you’ve memorized it, and can spit it out on an exam. This is definitely a problem for freshmen and sophomores. 
    
-   There’s this additional resistance to it because they’re convinced that what they’re doing is not what they should be doing, and overcoming that is hard. 
    
-   A student told me around week two or three that I was the most irritating professor he had ever had, but then around week seven or weight he said, you are the most irritating professor I’ve ever had, but I have enjoyed this more than I’ve enjoyed any other course. 
    
-   So, it’s incredibly important to recognize that people will be uncomfortable. And you’ll also get pushback from colleagues, for the same reason you get pushback from students. They think learning is them standing up and being the expert and telling their students oodles of info. They have expressed discomfort with the idea that you just give them a single problem to work through and that your role is incredibly diminished - they’re like, so what did you do? You get credit for teaching this way? 
    
-   So we start slowly and give you the simplest problem, that only involves you identifying one key concept, and it was almost impossible for you guys to do. At the end of the course, you could have nailed it in two days. So be wary of overestimating what people can do. As teachers, we forget what it’s like to not know things. 
    
-   We also tested the problems we came up with using small groups of students, trying to figure out whether they were solvable, or whether they can identify the concepts that they need to know, if they had sufficient backgrounds. Know your audience, understand their capabilities. 
    
-   After running this class a couple of times, you probably know what the sticking points are, but every student, every class is different. Make sure you get lots and lots of feedback from students and that you are able to respond. 
    
-   Now that I’m teaching this class for 60 students, that’s especially more important. It’s a hybrid of lecture and problem-solving, and I use top hat multiple times throughout a class. 
    

-   Q: Can you tell me more about this hybrid format? I was actually curious if you thought the format would be scalable. 
    

-   It’s modeled off what we did, more or less, but the problems are different. They have to be super constrained, unlike the original problems. They have to be solvable in a class period, with only one or two key lectures prior to that. They’ll watch these pre-recorded five/ten minute lectures about a concept, with a small quiz to make sure they got a good handle on the concept first. 
    
-   Then they do the same thing - sit in groups, and we sit there and listen and help them through it, but more directly. They don’t have a week to go away and think about it. And a huge part of this is managing their expectations. Tell them this is going to be hard because they’ve never had to do it before (most likely) and to stick with it. We would solve a chunk of the problem and then we’d meet back together and I would ask them a question on top hat. 
    
-   The only reason it works for a class of 60 is that I quiz them all the time. They of course get the points just for responding, to incentive them to just think, even if they are wrong. But meaningful feedback is hard to collect, and it takes a lot of careful thought about how to do that. 
    
-   I ask them to draw a lot, which you might consider a drawback because it requires more thought and effort, but if you can draw something you understand it.Concept maps, especially
    
-   Everything has to be very clearly matched to the lesson plan and learning objectives. 
    

-   Q: Would the hybrid be more of an intermediate form between a traditional class and the pure problem-based one, or is it more of an advanced form (try to do it only after teaching the pure problem-based course a few times)? 
    

-   It’s definitely harder. After teaching the original version for three years, I had a much clearer sense of how to facilitate things in groups, how to contextualize problems for them, the importance of drawing, etc. And so the hard part about this new course is interweaving all of those different things. In a 15 week course with 45 individual days, lectures, problems, assessments: getting each set of things to work perfectly and leaving room for course-correction if students are struggling is a gigantic task. 
    
-   I took a semester off from teaching and did nothing but make this course.
    
-   I might have one lecture go for two days, but still everything has to be in register: the assessments have to work for the concepts and it has to give you feedback. And that’s only once you’ve gotten past the hurdle of figuring out what to present, which was a lot of effort. I went through textbooks and figured out what the conceptual learning goals were, which ones were important or not. So before even designing the course, I had to map all of that. It’s definitely easier to go from a textbook to five main concepts than from a textbook to 45. 
    
-   I had to design things to cover the essentials and some desirable ones, what are the instruments, where am I getting the data from? I pulled the data from papers. 
    
-   But the more familiarity you have with the problem-based approach, the easier all of this will be.**
