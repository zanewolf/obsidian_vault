These are hopefully fun to do an extremely valuable. Side projects should accomplish at least one of the two following goals: 
1. You learn a new skill
2. You show skills you already know, build a portfolio


Not all side projects need to end up in your portfolio, only projects your proud of or want more work like it. 

**What is a good side project?**
- Are you using a well-known dataset? 
- Is it tied to a current event? 
- Can you use a human scale, or make it relatable so people can find themselves in the data? 
- Is it your own dataset? 
- Are you redesigning an existing visualization? 
- Are you trying out a new visualization/interaction concept? 
- Are you trying to visualize an uncommon question? 
- Can you create engagement with you design?
