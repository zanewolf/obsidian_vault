- The lifecycle of a [[Dashboard]]
	- Birth: it is simple and pleasing and works
	- Growth: people ask for specific features and it grows in complexity
	- Multiplying: you need supplmental dashboards in order to fulfill all the requests, it is now a monster and the dashboard isn't updating cleanly because the files are so complicated
	- Death: people can't use it or find what they are looking for, or avoid the dashboard
	- Rebirth: you start over with a simple dashboard
- The problem isn't the user, but using the dashboards as a solution for any data-driven problem to begin with
	- "one dashboard to rule them all"
	- a product for all audiences is useful to none of them- ![[Pasted image 20230504140055.png]]
