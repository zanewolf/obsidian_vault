[How Pew Research Center uses small multiple charts](https://medium.com/pew-research-center-decoded/how-pew-research-center-uses-small-multiple-charts-2531bfc06419) 
- 'Small multiples often require more time for a reader to fully absorb than single panel information graphics, and any information graphics that require close study are not the ideal format to use for audiences with very limited time or attention. But for those readers who do have time and attention, a carefully designed set of small multiples can communicate a lot of information.'
- Think facet-wrap/facet-grid.
- It's a way of displaying the same information but repetitively to enhance comparison. This can also enhance readability and [[data accessibility]] if lots of the information, if plotted together, would overlap. 
- Common guidelines: 
	- use a title to highlight key finding, since there will most likely be several small ones, too
	- Use the same scale and style across the multiples - otherwise comparison because hard if not worthless
	- a reference line can help
	- Choose the order intentionally - not random or alphabetical unless alphabetical is useful(?)
	- annotations can help point out the significance of differences
