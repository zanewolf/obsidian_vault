- Science vs art tension, couldn't commit to either
- **Design is a mindset**
	- Working with data is really broad, and can necessitate wearing different hats
		- explorer hat, figuring out the insights and key points, the guide hat when trying to transform the data into a story

	- Title is tricky, different labels for different times, embracing new titles/experiences 
- **Don’t box yourself in and embrace the chaos**
	- Swiss Army Approach: tool kit to hack different things 
	- “ Hack of all trades master of none?
	- Responsibility to communicate story to audience, your creative input is what matters 
- **Don’t let a tool decide for you or your skillset, limit what you do**
- > “To create, we need the opportunity to collide. Creativity is not found within the comfort zone” - Bronwen
- **Tap into other brains to build empathy and create magic **
	- Finding the courage to disappoint and find what’s right for you. 
	- Balance in these key metrics: Purpose, time, ability, reward

- **Learn to say no, and say yes when it feels like a maybe**
	- if you've been asked to do something by someone that feels like it is outside your ability, keep in mind that they wouldn't have asked you to do it unless they thought you were capable. Take advantage of the opportunities that scare you and force you to grow
- **Feed your brain: find a creative buffet! **
	- Your unique voice
	- A voice doesn't mean you need to apply the same look and feel to each project. 
	- Respect your audience in the process. Can’t force our voice.
	- Giving people ways to respond to the data 
- **It’s not your voice, it’s what you say that matters **
	- there is no substitute for practice. Don't know what your voice is? Keep making stuff, you'll find it. 
	- You: your experience, network, sensibility + your wellbeing, happiness, doing stuff you like 
- **When in doubt listen to your second brain: your gut.**
- Q&A 
	- *If you have worked with scientists, what has been the biggest challenge and how did you overcome it?*
		- Agreeing on the message balancing completeness with clarity of message.  on how complete the story needs to be, and the clarity. Striking the right balance between complexity and clarity. With so much knowledge, often it’s hard for experts to filter it down, to distill it to the essentials. So my aim/challenge is often taking them on a journey to clarify the hierarchy of the information. I don’t particularly like to use the word “simplify” in my work. Complexity needs to be embraced. However the goal is to make the complexity more accessible. How do we get other people to understand it? We need to deconstruct it, and build a path to guide the audience through to digest the complexity. 
	- *How do you communicate the various titles to clients to make it clear what you can and cannot do?*
		- It’s really tricky to explain what I do, because I do juggle so many things: my work is sector and format agnostic. A solution for me is to mention multiple titles and share different types of portfolios based on what conversation I’m having (i.e. a portfolio to match my different hats). Sometimes it's people around you who put a label on your forehead. What would you recommend to do when you feel that this label is not reflecting who you are/ what you do? Or maybe something you were and are not anymore?After the book came out, it was like a business card to open conversation. Demand for marketing infographics. Great opportunity, but didn’t want to move forward with it. Infographics are so many different things. Couldn't remove “infographic designer” from my profile because I had published a book about it, but started declining. Introduce other colleagues. 
	- *What parts of the visualization process do you find the hardest, and what parts do you find the most fun?*
		- It’s the same. The hardest and the most rewarding part is laying the foundation. Cracking the puzzle and seeing how you’ll bring it to life. Execution is fun, but it’s planting the seed that is integral. Coming up with the idea. When you have a map to go on the journey, the journey is amazing. Where are we going? What are we going to see? Where are we going to stop? You've done loads of great collaborations! Given what you said about saying "no", how do you know which collaborations are worth pursuing?The Venn Diagram with the four bubbles: balancing different things. With self projects it’s about finding a complementary skill set. 
	- *What strategies have you developed to make it easier to share your work/progress/journey?*
		- Use different titles to present yourself. A diversity of creative portfolios with various focuses (i.e. UX/UI, infographics and illustrations, etc)Stretch yourself and share your work across different platforms: public speaking, blog posts. Being a part of the community (there are many groups and networks on dataviz) Be interesting, but also be interested. Share other people's work, celebrate others, ask questions, engage in a dialogue. 
	- *What are the 3 key things which make a good visualization ?*
		- Must be insightful. A super beautiful visual but if it doesn't say much, it's not enough. Must be compelling. Aesthetically pleasing and clear. Must be accessible + inclusive. (Something I am still learning... lots of food for thought at Outlier!).
	- *Does it help if data designers find a 'niche'? If yes, what kind of niches data designers usually have?*
		- It can definitely help, if a niche fits your interest and purpose. It could be a niche of subject (i.e. medical or health related dataviz), medium (i..e being specialised on one format: printed infographics, or scrollytelling, or ) or visual aesthetics.
		- Focusing may make it easier to dedicate yourself to developing the skills you need for that area of focus. It may help filter your projects, and make it easier to say yes/no. It might also make it easier to describe your work/experience.
		- However, it’s worth mentioning that trying to be too specific in how you work, may create barriers...it may limit what you end up doing and what you're exposed to.
		- I am not the best person to talk about specialising in a niche. My work is format and sector agnostic and I like to reinvent the form every single time based on the story and audience. 
	- *What are your favourite tools do you use to create these beautiful visualisation eg The Infographic History of the World*
		- I use a variety of tools (Excel, Tableau, Processing, Adobe Illustrator, Data Illustrator, RawGraph), and for interactive and custom data experience I tend to collaborate with developers. All the 100 infographics created for my book The Infographic History of the World were done using Excel (the data analysis) and Adobe Illustrator (the data presentation). 
	- *You mentioned respecting the audience. Can you tell us a bit more about how you do that?*
		- I guess this is about trying to guarantee that whatever you produce doesn't completely fail. Sharing WIP with potential audiences and asking for feedback: listening to how others respond to your ideas from early stages is fundamental in bridging the gap. Few works will fully engage everyone, and stimulate the intended reaction for maximum impact. That doesn't mean we shouldn't try!I think it's critical to anchor ourselves (as creators) around the PURPOSE and the WHO. What is our message? Who is our audience? Why is this relevant to them? If we try to thread these 3 questions into our design thinking...and the delivery of our outcome, we improve the odds of succeeding. Also, if in the process we can bring multiple perspectives to the table we will have a greater chance to build empathy and a greater chance to have impact. 
	- *Where do you find energy to keep going if you feel a lot of purpose for a specific project, but not a lot of reward, and not a lot of other people that think it is important too and want to spend time on it?*
		- This is a common problem: motivation is tricky. Sometimes we don’t see the potential long term benefit beyond the short term reward. In most of my self-initiated projects, I’ve encountered this feeling: wanting to give up thinking that others will not care. But I usually overcome that barrier keeping in mind that as creators, some things are worth creating, simply because you feel compelled to create them. Others will find it compelling too! Many of the most beautiful creations (design, buildings, art) were created not because they had certainty that they would succeed with an audience, but simply because they were inspired and challenged to experiment and try new things. Finally, in the process of creating we learn so much, that is also part of the reward we need to keep in mind!
	- *Do you ever feel "alone" in your work as an independent? *
		- In some ways, yes. The last year has been really challenging for pretty much everyone, as so many of us have to work from home. Though I technically am not part of an official team with an org chart, I try to keep in mind that there's a team element to pretty much everything I do. My clients are my team. If I'm working with a company or agency to deliver an outcome, I'm aware that there was a problem somewhere that was big enough, that someone created a brief, and looked for a partner for support. When we agree to work together on a solution, we become a team. In some ways, I try to keep in mind that there are all kinds of partnerships. So, I guess I never feel truly "alone" - but in the last year, I certainly have missed co-working environments...and the occasional post-work pint
