- Faunalytics
	- to make animal advocacy more effective through data
- Problems of Scale
	- most people art not aware of the scale of animals used in our daily lives. 
	- we killed 71 billion land animals (mostly chickens). 10 animals/person/year
	- doesn't include fishes
		- hard to guesstimate since measured in bulk and not individually
	- using weight is a way to separate ourselves. 550000 lbs of fish versus 1 billion individualy fish. You are not thinking about the fish, but the quantity of fish, so a step removed

- Problems of Strategy
	- should we promote veganism as a baseline, or incrementalism? 
	- it's hard to get people to go vegan
		- 84% of vegans return to eating animal products within 2 years
	- getting people to not eat meat on monday is a lot easier
	- small shifts in what we eat can make a difference
		- effect of 16 vegan people = 100 people just doing meatless monday
