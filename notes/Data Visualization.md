Data visualization, or information design, is essentially the field of displaying data. Data visualizations can help make information or ideas more sticky in the mind, since they grab more attention and engage the brain more than a paragraph might. They can personalize the data through interactivity with the reader. Thinking about the visualizations early on can help direct how the data is explored and what you might want to even visualize. It makes data easier to comprehend, since we can make patterns and outliers easier to pick out. 

Data visualization can also be about bringing beauty back into something that is purely analytical. It can also be a gateway to get people interested in and learning about new data analytical practices. 

Two main approaches include the [[Dashboard]], where you want the data to do most of the talking, and the storytelling approach, in which case you are relying on specific data to back up your narrative points. Both approaches have their own sources of [[Bias]]. 

- Dashboard
- Reports: information won't be updated, needs a bit of storytelling to explain insights
- PPT: information that updates monthly or less frequency, storytelling to explain insights, or if its going to be a presentation anyway
- Database: always asking for more details; user knows the business rules
- Chatbot: few key information but ones everyone should know, you can make it fun, and easy and immediate access
- Microsite: like a ppt but better, provides interactivity, update the data, easy to access using mobile
- An email

Need to make sure it's [[A good chart]]
