# Loud Numbers: Telling Stories with Data and Music
by Duncan Geere and Miriam Quick

- three types of sonification
	- audification 
		- a bunch of actual audio data that can then be stretched, and pitch shifted, and compressed and transformed to a point of understanding
	- parameter mapping
		- map data values onto different audio properties (pitch, volume, duration, bass, instrument type, temp, specific sounds)
	- Earcons/auditory icons
		- little audio clips that represent events (similar to phone notifications)
- pros of sound
	- better at time series data since it's naturally linear and experienced over time
	- emotive data (bell vs airhorn)
	- complex data

			- redesigning one chart every week
		- observablehq.com
	- show
		- developing your [[portfolio]]
			- shows you exist, what you do, what you're good at

			- only put projects you want to do more of, things you're proud of
- typical dataviz designer career path
	- ![[dataviscareerpath.png]]

- Keep a list of ideas
- https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural
- What makes a good [[Dataviz Side Projects]]? Use this as a checklist. 
	- Relevance: use well-known datasets, tied it to a current event, use a human scale, make it relatable so people can find themselves in the data
	- Originality: create your own dataset, make a redesign of an existing visualization, try a new visual/interaction concept, visualize an uncommon question, create engagement in your design
