# Meeting 1
- talk about what we want and need through some sort of framework
- options
	- stimulate ocean scholarship
	- promote cross-lab collaborations
	- increase awareness of on-campus resources
	- break down disciplinary barriers across campus
	- work together towards garnering additional resources
- Assess who and where we are
	- build our community, gauge our collective intellectual interest
- Short term goals
	- identify modest resources to develop our collective ideas such as cross-scoll programmming (science and art)
	- identify how to best compliment existing programs
		- HUCe, MSI, Origins, Mahindra, CGA, Center of Population and Development Studies
			- **Q: What holes currently exist with these programs**
			- these programs are each good, but don't cover the entire umbrella of what is going on in the ocean
			- plenty of marine scientists that aren't connected to the environment at all
			- in terms of resources, cross-share costs if things fall in each programs' wheelhouse
			- the intention isn't to build a gigantic center, but to facilitate cross-talk between existing programs, and maybe exhances the mission of all the other centers
			- 
- Long term goals
	- strategic fundraising the aligns with univeristy priorities
	- partner with other institutions to provide access for our students and labs to ocean
		- URI, WHOI, North Eastern
			- **Q: What resources exist at each of these places**
	- develop harvard-based ocean-centered program that leverages our strengths and compliments our existing programs
- Collective Resources
	- Just in Girguis Lab
		- Field expeditions
		- URI, RISD
		- Engagement with UN policymakers
			- **Q: When you provide advice on policymaking, is it just you, or a handful of scientists across. Would team-developed documents and responses be both possible in the current framework (I don't know what the process of providing feedback on these policies are), and doable?**
		- oceanographic instrumention and samplers
		- arts and events
		- commecting yout o Schmidt, REV Ocean, Ocean Exploration Trust
	- **Q: what would the organization for this affinity group look like? A board of directors from each representative group/program? **
	- two main things
		- database of resources, cataloging people, interests, missions, grants
			- re people: interests, tools, skills, resources, and NEEDS
		- developing a frame of communication between everything
		- coordinating groups
