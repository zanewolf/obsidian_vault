-  Key differences between a virtual dataviz and a physical dataviz
	- Time
		- It takes a lot more time to complete, but you can use this time to think about the project while you're doing it
		- Often in virtual visualization, you are just coding coding coding and don't have time to be introspective about it until after
	- Money
		- You have to physically buy, collect, order the materials and test them
		- It costs more in terms of time and money
	- Control
		- Learning to accept imperfection, there's no undo unless you start over
		- Imperfections can make it more human, more relatable between artist and audience
	- Temporary
		- Physical installations are often ephemeral in nature, and that can be really hard to put so much effort and time
		- Can't be updated in real time, likely
		- How do you tell the full story about what exists physically online?
